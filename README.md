# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository contains my work for the first course of **Deep Learning Specialization**, *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*.

It covers the fundamental conceptsw of neural networks and deep learning, including vectorized implementation, forward and backward propagation, and the construction and training of fully connected deep nerual networks. The notebooks focus on building core idea from scratch using NumPy, with an emphasis on understannding the underlying mathematic and algorithms.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organize following the course schedule, with each folder corresponding to one week of the course

- **week02/**
  - Assignment 1: Python basics and Numpy fundamentals
  - Assignemnt 2: Logistic regression with a neural network mindset

- **week03/**
  - Assignment 1: Shallow neural networks and planar data classificaiton

- **week04/**
  - Assignment 1: Buidling a deep neural network step by step
  - Assignment 2: Deep nerual network application
